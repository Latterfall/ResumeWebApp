index.bio_area.header=Short bio
index.bio_area.paragraph_1=Already then, my friends and I were enthusiastically taking our first steps in programming and learning Turbo Pascal.
index.bio_area.paragraph_2=I have an incomplete higher education, which I plan to continue in extramural after employment. I was studying at SPSTU majoring in 'Transportation management and logistics' and at SPSUT majoring in 'Infocommunication systems and networks'. But neither logistics nor the physical structure of networks interested me enough, so I interrupted my studies at universities, as it did not bring anything but melancholy and loss of time. However, there were positive aspects to studying at the university: I learned the basics of VBA, C ++ and Java. My passion for programming helped me quickly master the educational material, which was pleased not only by me, but also by other classmates :D Unfortunately, the first attempts to continue learning Java ran into a bunch of life obstacles.
index.bio_area.paragraph_3=After graduation, I got a job at Dom.ru as an assistant to the director of network operation, where I worked with success for a year. Among the wide range of my job responsibilities, there was a place for programming: I automated reporting and processed large amounts of data (with which Excel could not cope with standard tools) using VBA. I decided to change jobs after my friends invited me to participate in their start-up, where, again, there was a place to work with the code. There I got a little closer to the structure and operation of web applications. However, the project stalled. After all this, I firmly decided to connect my life with development and began my training!
